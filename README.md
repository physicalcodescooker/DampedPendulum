# Damped Driven Pendulum
A comprehensive study on the damped driven pendulum or harmonic oscillator and how it exhibits chaotic behaviour under special conditions. I then analyze some chaos paramters including lyapunov exponent, bifurcation diagram, etc.
The simulation is done in Python and the visualization in Matplotlib with the help of numppy.
